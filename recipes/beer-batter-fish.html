            <p class="description">This beer-battered fish is a great recipe and very easy to make. We often fish all 
                day with friends, and then cook the fish afterwards out on deck. Yummy and great!</p>

        <h2 class="title steps">Steps</h2>

            <ol class="steps">
                <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
                <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer to 185 degrees C. Rinse cod fillets, pat dry, and
                     season with salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>Mix flour, garlic powder, paprika, salt and pepper in a large bowl; add egg
                    and stir well to combine. Gradually mix in enough beer to make a thin batter.</li>
                <li>Dip cod fillets into the batter to coat. Carefully lower fillets, one at a 
                    time, into the hot oil.</li>
                <li>Fry several fillets at a time, turning once, until cooked through and golden 
                    brown, about 2 minutes per side.</li>
                <li>Drain on paper towels. Repeat to cook remaining fillets. Serve warm.</li>
